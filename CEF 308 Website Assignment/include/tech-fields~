							<strong style='font-family: monospace; font-size: 30px; text-decoration: underline;'>Materials Engineering</strong><br><br>
							<img src='./images/materials.jpeg' alt='materials image' class='imgstyle'>
							<p>Materials have always played a significant and defining role in human development, from the Stone Age to the material world of today. Materials are central to our prosperity and new materials hold the key to our future development. Material engineers therefore have an essential role in developing the materials of today and the future and in taking performance to the next level.<br><br>
							The field involves the discovery and design of new materials, with an emphasis on solids. The intellectual origins of materials science stem from the Enlightenment, when researchers began to use analytical thinking from chemistry, physics, and engineering to understand ancient, phenomenological observations in metallurgy and mineralogy. Materials science still incorporates elements of physics, chemistry, and engineering. As such, the field was long considered by academic institutions as a sub-field of these related fields. Beginning in the 1940s, materials science began to be more widely recognized as a specific and distinct field of science and engineering, and major technical universities around the world created dedicated schools of the study. <a href='https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/materials-science-and-engineering/' target='_blank' style='color: #f6ddcc; text-decoration: underline;'>Learn more...</a>

							<img src='./images/env.jpeg' alt='environmental image' class='imgstyle'>
							<p>Environmental engineering is the branch of engineering concerned with the application of scientific and engineering principles for protection of human populations from the effects of adverse environmental factors; protection of environments, both local and global, from potentially deleterious effects of natural and human activities; and improvement of environmental quality.
							<br><br>
							Environmental engineering can also be described as a branch of applied science and technology that addresses the issues of energy preservation, protection of assets and control of waste from human and animal activities. Furthermore, it is concerned with finding plausible solutions in the field of public health, such as waterborne diseases, implementing laws which promote adequate sanitation in urban, rural and recreational areas. It involves waste water management, air pollution control, recycling, waste disposal, radiation protection, industrial hygiene, animal agriculture, environmental sustainability, public health and environmental engineering law. It also includes studies on the environmental impact of proposed construction projects.
							<br><br>
							Environmental engineers study the effect of technological advances on the environment. To do so, they conduct studies on hazardous-waste management to evaluate the significance of such hazards, advise on treatment and containment, and develop regulations to prevent mishaps. Environmental engineers design municipal water supply and industrial wastewater treatment systems. They address local and worldwide environmental issues such as the effects of acid rain, global warming, ozone depletion, water pollution and air pollution from automobile exhausts and industrial sources. <a href='http://learningpath.org/articles/Free_Online_Environmental_Engineering_Courses_from_Top_Universities.html' target='_blank' style='color: #f6ddcc; text-decoration: underline;'>Learn more...</a>

							<img src='./images/bio.jpeg' alt='biotechnology image' class='imgstyle'>
							<p>Environmental biotechnology is biotechnology that is applied to and used to study the natural environment. Environmental biotechnology could also imply that one try to harness biological process for commercial uses and exploitation. The International Society for Environmental Biotechnology defines environmental biotechnology as "the development, use and regulation of biological systems for remediation of contaminated environments (land, air, water), and for environment-friendly processes (green manufacturing technologies and sustainable development)".
							<br><br>
							Environmental biotechnology can simply be described as "the optimal use of nature, in the form of plants, animals, bacteria, fungi and algae, to produce renewable energy, food and nutrients in a synergistic integrated cycle of profit making processes where the waste of each process becomes the feedstock for another process". <a href='http://www.environmentalscience.org/degree/environmental-biotechnology' target='_blank' style='color: #f6ddcc; text-decoration: underline;'>Learn more...</a></p><br><br>
							<strong style='font-family: monospace; font-size: 30px; text-decoration: underline;'>Software Engineering</strong><br><br>
							<img src='./images/soft.jpeg' alt='software image' class='imgstyle'>
							<p>Computer software engineers apply the principles and techniques of computer science, engineering, and mathematical analysis to the design, development, testing, and evaluation of the software and the systems that enable computers to perform their many applications.
							<br><br>
Software engineers are involved in the design and development of many types of software, including software for operating systems and network distribution, and software for compilers (which convert programs for execution on a computer). In programming, or coding, software engineers instruct a computer, line by line, how to perform a desired function. Software engineers must possess strong programming skills, but are often more concerned with developing algorithms and analyzing and solving programming problems than with actually writing code.
							<br><br>
Typically Software engineers, working in applications or systems development, analyze first the needs of the user. They then design, construct, test, and maintain computer applications software or systems to meet these needs. <a href='https://mva.microsoft.com/' style='color: #f6ddcc; text-decoration: underline;' target='_blank'>Learn more...</a>
