If you’re wondering about how to build a website (even for free), then this article will be helpful for you.

Have no idea where to start?  That’s perfectly normal, to be honest.

You’re not alone as for most people, building a website online is still a bit of a mystery.

For most people (including us a few years ago), creating a website is something that only IT geeks are capable of doing.

Well, that was the old school stereotype that most people had for coders (including us a few years ago when we struggled to get started – we confess!)

I’m not sure if it’s because of the media, movies, whatever. But that’s definitely not how a lot of websites are actually built nowadays, and that’s definitely not how coders behave!

You don’t need to be an IT geek to learn how to build a website from scratch today.

You don’t even need to know code (a bit will help, but not a necessity and it won’t hold you back), you don’t need to manage hosts / servers, and you don’t need to have a lot of money.

Here is a quick snapshot of some of the website builders nowadays that can help you build your website – without having to learn how to code or breaking your bank account.
